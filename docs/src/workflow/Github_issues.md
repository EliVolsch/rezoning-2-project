# Github issues:

Tickets on the github board are created first as github issues and converted into isses to work on during the sprint at the REZoning catchup meeting.

Each issue is sized according to its expected time to accomplish.

Each issue will have its priority assigned as label.

The order of issues on the SCRUM board will dictate the order of working on the tickets, meaning if the developer is blocked on a ticket he will default to working on the next ticket.
