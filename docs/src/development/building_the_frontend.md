# Using the front end with different rezoning API deployment setting: 

- In ```app/scripts/config/``` there are setting files for each envirnment type (local, production or staging).
- You can set which envirnment to use by setting NODE_ENV envirnment variable to "testing", "staging" or "development". 
- You can use a different MapBox key by writing a different mbToken in the config file.
- apiEndpoint in the settings file indicates the URL to the rezoning-explorer-api in use.
