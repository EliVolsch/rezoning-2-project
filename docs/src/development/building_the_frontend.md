`
nvm install v12
nvm use v12
`
- Install Yarn on ubunut using:

`
sudo apt install yarn
`
- Install npm dependendencies using:

`
yarn install
`
- Start server with live code reload at [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000):

`
yarn serve
`

- Run tests with:

`
yarn test
`

## Using the front end with different rezoning API deployment setting: 

- In scripts/config/ there are setting files for each envirnment type (local, production or staging).
- You can set which envirnment to use by setting NODE_ENV envirnment variable to "testing", "staging" or "development". 
- You can use a different MapBox key by writing a different mbToken in the config file.
- apiEndpoint in the settings file indicates the URL to the rezoning-explorer-api in use.
